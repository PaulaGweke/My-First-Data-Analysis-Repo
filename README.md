# My-First-Data-Analysis-Repo - Financial Analysis

# Project Objectives
* The project consist of financial report of  manufacturing and sales of 5 products (Paseo, VTT, Amarilla, Velo, Montana and Carretera) across five regions (Canada, France, Germany, Mexico and USA) to monitor sales across products and regions.

# Data Sourcing
* Data was imported from https://aka.ms/30DLDATFinanceDataSample as part of the material source for 30 days data analytic learning with Excel and PowerBI

# Data Transformation
* The data does not have any blank entry and so no data cleaning was done upon transforming in Excel

# Data Findings
* Most profit was made from Country/Region:France, Product:Paseo and Segment:Government
* Least profit was made from Country/Region:Mexico, Product:Carretera and Segment:Enterprise
* Canada sold the most unit which was 22% of all unit total sold
* Goverment made 63% of the profit while Enterprise made 3% loss of the total profit
* The Month of October has the most sales and most discount
* There is some trend between increasing in units sold per month and profit. However, the highest profit per month did not come from the highest unit sold per month. Highest profit month is December while highest unit sold month October
* Highest profit was made from products having low discounts and least profit was made from products having no discount
* Loss was made from product with high and medium discounts only, mostly from Enterprise segment
* High discount sales from mostly Enterprise segment caused total Cost of Manufacturing for Caterera and VTT to be more than the total sales.
* Enterprise segment purchased mostly from high and medium discounts goods
* Findings are displayed in Charts of https://github.com/PaulaGweke/My-First-Data-Analysis-Repo/blob/main/Financial_Analysis.xlsx

# Recommendation
* Unit sales price has unit sales price with discount applied. The Spreadsheet should separate unit price with and without discount
* The Financial sales is for September 2013 to December 2014. The financial report should be divided into fiscal year e.g September 2013 to August 2014 or for January 2014 to December 2014. However, the use of field bottons and timeline filters in Excel can be used to display separate results for 2013 and 2014
* The distribution of profit across the discount range suggest that customers are motivated by offers of discounts. However, the use of high to medium discount have the tendency to cause loss while not having much improvement on profit. Hence the High and medium discounts should be removed or restricted to select months for short periods of holidays.
* Also, the low turnover from Enterprise should be monitored with implementation of the restricted high to medium discounts; if sales from Enterprise still continues to produce loss, consideration to disband that segment should be made.
